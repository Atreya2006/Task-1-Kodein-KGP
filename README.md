# End to end encrypted chatroom implemented using TCP and encrypted using RSA algorithm
Here the encryption was done using the RSA algorithm , where we use the public key and private key generated by the Euler Totient Function
The connection between the two terminals was established using TCP, we can use UDP as well.

Precaution:
suitable for 2 clients and 1 server at a time , otheriwse it might crash
if there is some traceback error in the terminal , then re execute the file in terminal
to execute , locate the directory where the 2 files are stored, then use the "python chat_server.py" command followed by "python chat_client.py" in the 2 other terminals 
type the respective names in the terminals , then start the conversation
here , for the 2 clients to know what the other client is typing it must have the chat_server file open on his terminal, as the text comes as encrypted in chat_client terminal
